# Our Coding Tutorial
#### *created by Siddhant Lodha, Aauysh Shah, and Aarnav Uli*

We have created a coding tutorial where we teach the basics of the two most important web design languages:
`HTML` and `CSS`

- We teach about things like syntax, headers, paragraphs, titles, images, videos, audio, tables, lists, etc.
- We also teach about how to style text, backgrounds and more!
- In addition to that, we also lots of code examples and you can see what the result looks like. You can also edit the examples and run them to see what happens!

To see our tutorial, run the `run.py` python file. Then you can see our tutorials on the localhost at `127.0.0.1:5000/htmlTutorial` and `127.0.0.1:5000/cssTutorial`
